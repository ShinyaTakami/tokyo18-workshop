## What is the purpose of this workshop?

This workshop is intended to bring together experts to evaluate the current status and explore future directions of visually-rich long-form digital publications based on Web Technologies (particularly CSS, the formatting language of the Web), encompassing both fixed and dynamic layouts.  Such “high-design” publications, with complex or sophisticated layout, may be sequential art (Comics, Manga, Bandes Dessinées, etc.), magazines, picture books, cookbooks, educational materials, etc.

Participants in the workshop will:
* Share current practices in creating high-design digital publications.
* Share emerging new-form sequential art presentation experiences such as interstitial interactivity and other presentations that transcend replication of print forms
* Identify mismatches between existing Web technologies and these current practices, helping to inform and guide current standards development work, and potentially to help instigate new work.


## Which topics will be covered?
{: #topics}

The actual agenda of a W3C Workshop is built based on proposals sent by attendees and evaluated by the Program Committee. The topics listed below illustrate the topics we intend to cover. Participants are encouraged to submit a topic in the form of a position statement, either on the topics explicitly listed or on a topic they think would be a good match.

The tentative list of topics is as follows:

* Advanced layout using recent and upcoming CSS innovations, particularly for mobile and other devices (CSS grid, viewport units, media queries, css-shapes, etc.)
* “Smart transitions” for manga/comics including “Turbo Media” and other new forms
* Analysis of proprietary platforms in comics, magazines, and other verticals
* Comparison of image-dominated and text-dominated fixed-layout (and considerations for choosing reflowable vs. fixed representations, such as accessibility)
* Differences between rendering of fixed-layout EPUB in dedicated EPUB reading systems and typical browser rendering of HTML-SVG-CSS, and considerations for convergence
* Accessibility for high-design digital publications
* Innovative and interactive high-design digital publications
* Use of interactive features (e.g., scroll snap) of CSS for sequential art
* Programmatic (JavaScript) vs. declarative (HTML/CSS, SVG) representations
* Lessons learned from  IDPF efforts on advanced hybrid layout and page templates
* Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques as applied to content production (such as inferring CSS layouts from images) and accessibility (such as inferring reading order and other accessibility characteristics)
* Internationalization of high-design digital publications
* Print formatting of high-design publications via CSS
* Responsive design for long-form publications
* Possibilities afforded by emerging Web Fonts capabilities (chromatic fonts, variable fonts, etc.)
* Color management

## How can I attend?

Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members, who have received an acceptance email in order to attend.

In addition, you are encouraged to submit a presentation topic in the form of a [position statement](#position-statements).

Our aim is to fill the room with people with practical experience and get a diversity of attendees from a variety of industries and communities, including:

* Publishers from multiple segments (manga/comics, magazines, trade ebooks, learning content, etc.)
* Authoring tool developers
* Browser developers
* Web Standards experts
* Web developers
* Developers of commercial and open source publishing technology middleware and services
* Other SDOs involved in related standard setting

This workshop, as other W3C meetings, operates under the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

Also, be sure to keep an eye on [these important dates](#dates).

## How can I suggest a presentation?
{: #position-statements}

This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.

In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.

If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement (<span class="todo">WBS to be set up</span>) by the deadline (see [important dates](#dates)). Our program committee will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.

A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:

* Your background in the main [topic areas](#topics) of the workshop.
* Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.
* Links to related supporting resources.
* Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.
* A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.
* Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.

## What is W3C?

The [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org) is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and communities to help structure productive discussions around existing and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free patent framework for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on client-side (browser) technologies, and also have a mature history of vocabulary (or “ontology”) development. W3C develops work based on the priorities of our members and our community.
