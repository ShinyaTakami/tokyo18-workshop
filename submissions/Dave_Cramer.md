# Dave Cramer: Position Paper


Just received approval to attend the workshop! Here's a quick summary
of what I might want to show at the workshop:

At Hachette, we have been publishing books with an entirely HTML-based
workflow for more than eight years. Print and digital publications
share literally the same HTML content, differing only in style and
packaging. CSS is the key to creating books, and we can think of print
as a discrete point on a continuum of responsive designs. I'd like to
demonstrate how we might produce a four-color travel guide, and how
responsive CSS could be adapted to also produce a high-quality print
edition.

Thanks,

Dave Cramer
