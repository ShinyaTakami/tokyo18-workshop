# Myles Maxfield: Position Paper

I’m Myles C. Maxfield, a co-editor of the CSS Fonts specs. I’m also a software engineer working on the WebKit browser engine. I’ve been working on text and fonts in WebKit for around 5 years, and have gained expertise in this area.

I was hoping to become a speaker for the Workshop on Digital Publication Layout and Presentation. I’ve seen many epub authors stick to a particular form of markup/CSS in the past years. However, many of these so-called “best practices” are outdated and are no longer the state-of-the-art of Web technologies. I’d like to speak about the capabilities of modern web engines, and how these facilities can be leveraged to make different types of publications. I’m hoping to help the industry understand what is possible, as well as giving them a starting point to learn more about these technologies.

Thanks,  
Myles
