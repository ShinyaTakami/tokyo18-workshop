# Rachel Andrew: Position Paper

I care about this topic as a specification editor in the CSS Working Group, co-editor of two specifications (Multiple-column Layout and Page Floats) that are of as much interest to the print and EPUB world as they are to web developers. It would be interesting and informative for me to be involved in the workshop on that basis. I have significant professional experience in CSS for layout as a web developer, CSS Working Group Invited Expert and as an educator having written or co-authored a large number of books on the subject since 2002, my most recent “The New CSS Layout” published last year. I run frequent workshops and present at over 30 conferences a year on these topics. 

I propose a workshop covering the advances in CSS Layout in the past couple of years - Flexbox, Grid and their relationship to Writing Modes. I would be happy to present this as a typical presentation format, of around 45 minutes. Or could present a smaller subset of information with time for Q&A or discussion. 

I would like attendees to gain an appreciation for how CSS has developed in terms of layout over the last few years and hopefully to feel inspired to not only use these new capabilities in their work but to be keen to offer feedback to the process in future.

Due to a prior commitment I won’t be able to fly out from Berlin until Monday morning, which would mean that speaking on day 1 might be tricky if I had any flight delays so I would prefer to speak day 2.
