## Bobby Tung: Position Paper


### Background

1.  Editor of "CLREQ" and invited expert of i18n WG.
2.  Editor of EPUB 3 authoring guide in Taiwan - it\'s a branch of EBPAJ
    EPUB 3 authoring guide, Japan, arranged for Traditional Chinese text
    and layout.
3.  I provide EPUB 3 authoring service to publishers in Taiwan. Have
    great experience in fixed layout and mixed layout EPUB authoring.

### My goal

I'd like to have a short presentation and a topic to discuss.

#### Bopomofo Layout with OpenType font feature.

Five years ago, I attended the i18n workshop in Keio Univ. to place a
presentation for the status and requirement of Bopomofo layout.

Now it\'s nearly done. The last step is to use OpenType feature for
arranging tone mark\'s position. Recently we published a test font file
and it worked on Firefox and Google Chrome (see [Bopomofo on the Web](https://github.com/bobbytung/Bopomofo_on_Web)).


It's a good case from i18n requirement and thorough HTML5 standard (the
ruby markup), to CSS (ruby-position) and font (OpenType GPOS 'vert'
feature). Finally back to asking browsers\' support.

This workshop focus on advance layout, but also a good chance for me to
finalize the Bopomofo issue.

#### Discuss Mixed layout EPUB display fragmentation.

EPUB 3 standard allows to insert pre-paginated asset in a reflow book.
It\'s an important feature for authors to make digital publications in
great layout. But it\'s not widely supported by all reading systems.

If we can fill the gap between reading systems, it will be great help to
improve current digital publication\'s presentation.
