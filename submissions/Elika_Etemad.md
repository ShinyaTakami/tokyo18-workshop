# Elika Etemad (Fantasai): Position Paper


I wanted to suggest a discussion of the nature of CSS, its design principles,
its methods of adapting to various environments, and how these are applied
through the standardization process at W3C, to help people understand what
CSS is and can be capable of, and encourage attendees to imagine the
possibilities of the future both in applying CSS in their work and in
extending CSS to accommodate their needs.

My background in this topic is being one of the primary tech leads in the
CSSWG for more than a decade, with specialization in layout, typesetting,
and internationalization, and prior background in development on Mozilla's
layout engine.

Here are some previous talks I've given:
