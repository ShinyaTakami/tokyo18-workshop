# What is the purpose of this workshop?

This workshop is intended to bring together experts to evaluate the current status and explore future directions of visually-rich long-form digital publications based on Web Technologies (particularly CSS, the formatting language of the Web), encompassing both fixed and dynamic layouts.  Such “high-design” publications, with complex or sophisticated layout, may be sequential art (Comics, Manga, Bandes Dessinées, etc.), magazines, picture books, cookbooks, educational materials, etc.

Participants in the workshop will:
* Share current practices in creating high-design digital publications.
* Share emerging new-form sequential art presentation experiences such as interstitial interactivity and other presentations that transcend replication of print forms
* Identify mismatches between existing Web technologies and these current practices, helping to inform and guide current standards development work, and potentially to help instigate new work. See the separate [Call for Participation](./cfp) for more details on the program, how to participate, etc.
